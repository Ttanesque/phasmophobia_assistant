      "The Banshee is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. The Banshee is a natural hunter and will attack anything. It has been known to stalk its prey one at a time until it makes its kill.",
  "banshee.description2":
      "Unlike other ghosts, who will often change their selected target between Hunts, Banshees will always target the same player every time it hunts until it successfully kills them. While this means other players are safe from the Banshee's power so long as its target is alive, it makes carrying out objectives by the targeted player more difficult.",

  "crucifix.description": "Prevent the Ghost from hunting with a Crucifix.",
  "crucifix.details":
      "For the Crucifix to successfully prevent a hunt, it must be in the vicinity of the ghost when it starts the hunt. The Crucifix has a range of 3 meters for most ghosts, and 5 meters for the Banshee. When the ghost initiates the hunt, it checks to see if it is in range of a crucifix. If it is, the hunt does not begin, turning all the lights off and taking one of two charges the Crucifix has.",
  "demon.description1":
      "Demons are one of the twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. It is generally regarded as the most dangerous type of ghost to encounter; noted for being highly aggressive, it will attack more often than any other ghost, and usually without warning. Though it may frequently hinder more conventional methods of investigation, it will also allow ghost hunters to use the Ouija Board without reducing their sanity if a question is answered successfully, allowing for critical information to be obtained with a bit of safety to sanity.",
  "demon.description2":
      "If the investigation and objectives are not dealt with quickly, Demons can grow to be the most challenging ghost. They are notorious for initiating hunts frequently, a trait that is exacerbated by lower sanity levels, and compounded by higher difficulties like Professional where hunts last much longer. Taking all of these factors into account, Demons at their most aggressive will hunt in intervals as short as half-minutes, forcing the players to spend more total time hiding than investigating.",
  "demon.strength": "Demons are the most aggressive and enter hunt mode more.",

      "Fingerprints (or Handprints) are a type of Evidence created by Ghosts that help to indicate which type of Ghost is haunting the location. They are left behind by when they interact with the location's environment. You can see Fingerprints by using the UV Flashlight or the Glowstick.",
  "fingerprints.howitworks1":
      "A ghost will leave behind Fingerprints when it interacts with the environment, the most reliable being the following: Interacting with a door; Interacting with a light switch; Knocking on a window.",
  "fingerprints.howitworks2":
      "Note that when the ghost flickers the lights or touches the Fuse Box, they will not always leave behind Fingerprints.",
  "fingerprints.howitworks3":
      "Sometimes, ghosts can leave fingerprints in strange places, such as the outside of the windows at Brownstone High School, though this is likely due to being a bug.",
  "fingerprints.howitworks4":
      "Fingerprints do not have to be visible when being photographed by a Photo Camera, and will be labeled as \"Fingerprints\" in the Journal. This allows for Fingerprints to be discovered accidentally with an errant photograph.",

  "freezing.temperatures.howitworks1":
      "Temperature will start to decrease in a room that a ghost occupies; if Freezing Temperatures is a piece of evidence, the temperature will drop three times as fast. When a Ghost is present in a room where Freezing Temperatures is not a piece of evidence, it can only reduce the temperature to 5°C/40.9°F. However, there is an error margin of 2° on the Thermometer, so a room can appear to be as low as 3°C/37.9°F if the ghost does not cause Freezing Temperatures.",
  "freezing.temperatures.howitworks2":
      "Freezing Temperatures will also cause investigators to release visible exhalations both on camera and in person once the temperature drops low enough.

  "ghost.orbs.howitworks1":
      "They are emitted in the Ghost Room, and look like very small yellow orbs that glide across the screen, generally one at a time.

      "The Jinn is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. It is a territorial ghost that will attack when threatened. It has also been known to travel at significant speed during Hunts.",
  "jinn.description2":
      "Jinns tend to interact with electronics more than any other ghost. They may cause phones to ring, radios to activate, TV's to turn on, or car alarms to go off more often. This also extends to light switches, which may cause unsure investigators to confuse a Jinn for a Mare or Poltergeist; although Mares also have the power to turn lights off, they will not often turn lights back on as Jinn do, and Poltergeists will likely disturb more general objects that aren't light switches such as doors.",
  "jinn.strength":
      "A Jinn will travel at a faster speed if its victim is far away.",

  "mare.description1":
      "The Mare is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. It is the source of all nightmares, making it most powerful in the dark. Mares have a higher chance of initiating hunts when players are in darkness, especially if the lights are turned off in the ghost room. It tends to turn lights and the fuse box off more than any other ghost type when active, although if a ghost switches lights back on, it is much more likely to be a Poltergeist or Jinn. An active Mare stalking low-sanity players have the capacity to initiate hunts within mere moments of each other, allowing them to rival even Demons in aggression.",

      "The Motion Sensor is a purchasable support item. It is the most expensive piece of equipment in the game, costing \$100, but it can be very handy when tracking the movement of the Ghost, providing a visual and audio cue when the ghost moves through it. The Motion Sensor also displays on the Site Map, allowing for the Ghost's movement to be detected from the safety of the Van.",
  "oni.description1":
      "The Oni is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. It is similar to the Demon, and as such, is much more active and aggressive when players are grouped together, with a higher chance to initiate hunts. This can make players confuse it with a Demon provided they continue to remain close together the entire mission and never separating. However, this power also works against it; it is one of the most active ghosts in the game, and will more readily give up evidence to a group of investigators, which can make for generous and swift investigations if an Oni is quick to reveal the necessary evidence.",
  "oni.description2":
      "Unlike with most other ghost types, splitting up is the best method of defense when searching for an Oni, as it much less active while players are alone. Though this can be a disadvantageous strategy, particularly if the ghost is revealed to be a Banshee, it can also allow players to find the Ghost Room quicker, as well as keep them from huddling together in hiding spaces during hunts.",
  "oni.description3":
      "The Oni is also described as being extremely strong, and it will throw objects around the room with great force when interacting with them. However, these objects are not dangerous to the hunters or their sanity unlike those thrown by Poltergeists.",
  "oni.strength":

  "revenant.description2":
      "Unlike other Ghosts, who will often have a specific target selected when starting a Hunt they will hone in on, Revenants can freely switch targets if there is another player that is closer by - and especially one that is in plain view and available, making its goal of killing players more convenient.",

  "shade.description1":
      "Noted as being shy ghosts, Shades lower their activity in the presence of multiple investigators. Because of its temperament, it can be harder to find Ghost Activity when sticking together. However, like all ghosts in the game, the Shade is more likely to hunt when the players' Sanity is low.",
  "shade.description2":
      "If a Shade is already hunting, it will prefer to target players that are alone. The Shade follows the general definition of \"alone\", in the sense of a player being in a room on their own, even if other players are physically close.",

      "To use the Spirit Box, you must be in the same room as the Ghost, or within 3 meters if not in the same room, for it to answer.
